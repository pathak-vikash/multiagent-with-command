### **Appointment SOP Checklist**  

1. **Agenda:** 
   - Ask the user to clearly state the purpose of the appointment.

2. **Service:**
   - Based on the `agenda`, determine the type of service for which appointment is scheduled. In case not sure, let's present the list of services and ask user to select one.
   - Possible values can be 'inspection', 'repair', 'maintenance', 'installation', 'replacement', 'consultation', 'other'.

3. **Timing:**  
   - Collect the user's preferred dates and time.
   - Ensure the date and time should be in future not in past.

4. **Location:**
   - Ask the user to specify their service location (city, state, or country). If user already shared location in context or user profile then use that location and confirm the same.
   - If user has not shared location then ask for location.

5. **Contact:**  
   - Confirm user communication preferences to receive the appointment details. It can be email or phone.
   - It should use to further communicate with user and any updates related to appointment or services.
